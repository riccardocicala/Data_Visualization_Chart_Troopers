								Climate Trends in Europe: A Growing Challenge
							</h3>
							<p>
								The plot illustrates two indices, Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD), calculated daily using the following formulas:
								HDD = max(18 - T, 0); CDD = max(T - 21, 0); where T represents the daily temperature.
								<br>The HDD index measures the difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures, indicating how much heating is required to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.
								<br>Conversely, the CDD index reflects the cooling needed to offset the outdoor temperature's impact on indoor comfort.
								<br>The data are aggregated annually, with yearly values obtained by summing the daily calculations for each respective year.
 								<br>The plot covers <span style="color:blue; margin: 0;">European HDDs</span> and <span style="color:red; margin: 0;">European CDDs</span> from 1979 to 2023. Given the stark differences in values between the two indices, the graph uses a dual vertical axis:
								the left axis represents HDDs, while the right axis represents CDDs.
								The horizontal axis displays the years from 1979 to 2023.	
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="plot1"></div>
						<div class="large-description">
							<p>
								The plot clearly demonstrates a steady decrease in HDDs alongside a consistent increase in CDDs over time.
								This trend highlights the gradual warming of winters and summers in Europe, indicating a shift towards a warmer climate over the years.
								The pronounced nature of these changes underscores the urgency of addressing this issue.
								<br><br>As this trend continues, the situation is likely to become increasingly challenging, leading to greater environmental consequences.
								Immediate action is essential if we want to mitigate these impacts and change the trend.

								Warming Winters: Tracking Europe's Heating Degree Days (HDDs)
							</h3>
							<p>
								The HDD (Heating Degree Days) index measures the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures, providing an estimate of the heating required to maintain indoor comfort.
								<br>It is calculated using the formula: <b>HDD = max(18 - T, 0)</b>, where <i>T</i> represents the mean daily temperature.
								<br><br>The data, presented with annual granularity, are derived by summing the daily HDD values for each year.
								<br><br>The map illustrates this data, showing European countries in varying shades of blue, while non-European Union countries, for which data are unavailable, are displayed in gray. Darker blue shades represent higher HDD values, while lighter blue shades indicate lower values.
								<br><br>A slider on the left allows users to select a specific year, enabling a comparison of HDD values across time.
								<br><br>The visualization reveals a noticeable trend: in earlier years, much darker shades of blue covered Europe, reflecting colder winters. Over time, the map transitions to lighter shades, highlighting the gradual warming of winters across Europe.

								The CDD (Cooling Degree Days) index measures the difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures, providing an estimate of the cooling required to maintain indoor comfort. It is calculated using the formula: <b>CDD = max(T - 21, 0)</b>, where <i>T</i> represents the mean daily temperature.
								<br><br>The data, aggregated annually, represent the sum of daily CDD values for each year.
								<br><br>On the map, European countries are displayed in varying shades of red, while non-European Union countries, for which data are unavailable, are shown in gray. Darker red shades indicate higher CDD values, while lighter shades signify lower values.
								<br><br>A slider on the left allows users to select a specific year, offering a dynamic view of CDD trends over time.
								<br><br>The visualization reveals a clear pattern: in earlier years, much lighter red shades dominated, especially in southern European countries. Over time, darker shades have become more prevalent, highlighting the increasing warmth of summers across Europe.

								Ocean Acidification
							</h3>
							<p>
								The heatmap shows the pH value of the ocean as the years change (starting from 1985).
								<br><br>On the horizontal axis we can find the years while on the vertical axis we have a single value, pH.
								<br>Shades of red indicate pH values lower than the optimal value 8.2 (in white), the darker red the further away we are from the optimal value.
								<br><br>As we can see going forward in years the sea is becoming more and more acidic and even in 1985 we were already far away from the optimal value that was present before the industrial revolution.
								<br>Ocean acidification can create conditions that eat away at the minerals used by oysters, clams, lobsters, shrimp, coral reefs, and other marine life to build their shells and skeletons.
								<br>In addition, a rapid shift in pH levels could cause other life forms to go extinct, as they may be unable to adapt swiftly enough to these changes.

								European Economic Losses: a growing trend
							</h3>
							<p>
								Many times when we talk about global warming someone intervenes by saying that climate change has always been there, thus somehow lifting the blame that human beings have in this change.
								<br>So it is also important to show the fact that we are the first to lose from this change, in fact the plot shows the rolling average of the last 30 years of european econimical losses due to climate change as the years change.
								<br><br>This measurement is perfect for showing the trend of a variable, which as in this case points out to us how economic losses are steadily and steeply increasing.
								<br><br>On the horizontal axis, the years are displayed, while the vertical axis represents economic losses in bilions of euros. Notably, the trend experienced slight drops only between 2011 and 2012 and between 2019 and 2020. In all other years, the losses have consistently risen.

								Over the years, the Sankey diagram highlights notable 
								trends in energy consumption across sectors, 
								countries, and fuel types. Household and commercial 
								energy consumption has remained stable, reflecting 
								consistent energy demands in these areas. 
								Industrial energy use has shown a slight decline, 
								possibly due to advancements in efficiency or shifts 
								in industrial activity. In contrast, the transport 
								sector has experienced an increase, 
								likely driven by growing mobility needs and 
								economic development.

								<br><br>Among the countries, energy consumption has 
								decreased in Germany, Italy, France, and the 
								Netherlands, while it has increased in Poland. 
								Spain and Sweden have maintained stable levels, 
								and smaller, niche consumers have continued to 
								consume energy at consistent rates. 
								The primary consumers remain Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and Poland, 
								emphasizing their significant role in overall energy demand.

								<br><br>Regarding fuel types, oil and petroleum products 
								have seen a modest increase, while natural gas 
								and electricity consumption initially rose but 
								then declined in more recent years. Renewables 
								and biofuels have grown significantly, reflecting 
								the push for sustainable energy solutions, whereas 
								solid fossil fuels have experienced a notable decrease. 
								Niche fuels have maintained a relatively consistent 
								presence without substantial changes over time.

								Top 5 Fuel Types and Their Distribution Among Top 5 Leading Countries
							</h3>
							<p>
								These two plots provide an interactive overview of 
								energy consumption trends, allowing for a focused 
								analysis of fuel types and their distribution among 
								the top-consuming countries in the selected year.

								<br><br>The bar plot on the left displays the top 5 fuel types 
								by total energy consumption for the selected year. 
								This visualization highlights the most significant 
								energy sources, enabling comparisons of their relative 
								contributions.

								<br><br>The stacked bar plot on the right focuses on the top 5 
								countries with the highest consumption of these fuel 
								types. Each bar represents the total energy consumed by 
								a country only with respect to these fuel types, 
								broken down into stacks that correspond to 
								the contributions of each of these.

								<br><br>Using the year slider, you can dynamically explore how 
								the importance of fuel types and their distribution 
								across countries evolves over time. Together, 
								these plots provide a comprehensive view of the 
								interplay between fuel type dominance and

							<p>
								Over the years, the two plots highlight consistent 
								trends in energy consumption patterns, 
								with some notable changes in fuel preferences 
								and usage levels. Gas oil and diesel oil 
								have consistently ranked as the top fuel type, 
								with France and Germany always leading in their 
								consumption. Motor gasoline has remained the 
								second most consumed fuel, with Germany being 
								its primary user. Blended biodiesels have consistently 
								held third place, primarily used by Germany and 
								France, while Italy and Poland have shown a 
								preference for liquefied petroleum gases. 
								This fuel type was fourth until the last two years, 
								when it dropped to fifth and then exited the 
								top five altogether.

								<br><br>Natural gas appeared in fifth place only 
								in 2014 before being replaced by kerosene-type jet 
								fuel and, from 2020 onward, by electricity. 
								The rise of electricity in the rankings indicates a 
								gradual shift toward sustainability, 
								though it remains a niche fuel alongside 
								other less commonly used types.

								<br><br>Despite fluctuations in specific fuels, 
								the leading countries—Germany, France, Italy, 
								Spain, and Poland—have consistently dominated 
								the top ranks. Spain and Poland stand out as 
								the only countries with an overall increase in 
								energy consumption since 2014. In the last two years, 
								the total consumption of the top five fuels has 
								diminished, reflecting broader efficiency efforts or 
								shifts in energy policies.

								<br><br>The dominance of gas oil and motor gasoline 
								remains significant, with gas oil far outpacing 
								motor gasoline in consumption, while all other 
								uels collectively trail far behind these two in 
								importance. This underscores the enduring reliance 
								on these key fuel types despite gradual shifts toward 
								more sustainable options.

								Plot 9
							</h3>
							<p>
								The multiline plot shows the waste disposed of in 
								million tonnes over the years, with each line 
								representing a different waste disposal or recovery 
								operation. The disposal operations include 
								incineration, landfilling, and others, 
								while the recovery operations comprise recycling, 
								energy recovery, and backfilling. Two green lines 
								represent the average trends for recovery and disposal, 
								while individual gray lines correspond to specific 
								operations and are highlighted when hovered over.

								<br><br>The recovery trend has remained relatively stable 
								since 2014, suggesting limited progress in 
								increasing recovery efforts. 
								However, it is encouraging to see that recycling 
								consistently surpasses all others, 
								both in recovery and disposal, indicating its 
								central role in waste management. Backfilling 
								has shown a noticeable increase, which is 
								another positive sign for recovery.

								<br><br>On the other hand, disposal operations have declined 
								over time, which is positive for sustainability. Among these, 
								landfilling has seen the most significant decrease, 
								followed by incineration, reflecting efforts to 
								reduce reliance on traditional disposal methods 
								in favor of more sustainable waste management 
								practices.

								Zero-Emission Vehicle Adoption Across Europe
							</h3>
							<p>
								The multiline plot illustrates the percentage of zero-emission vehicles
								across various European countries over the years, 
								with the y-axis showing the percentage and the x-axis 
								representing the years. Each line corresponds to a different 
								country, and the European Union average is marked with a green line. 
								Individual country trends can be highlighted when hovered over.

								<br><br>For buses, motor coaches, and trolley buses, countries such as 
								the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Denmark showed 
								remarkable growth, starting low in 2014 and increasing significantly.  
								These trends could be linked to strong governmental policies, subsidies, 
								and public investment in green public transportation. 
								Conversely, Bulgaria exhibited a unique trend, starting very high and 
								ending considerably lower. which may be due to initial reliance on 
								trolleybuses or similar vehicles that were later phased out or replaced. 
								Despite some variations, most countries saw 
								substantial growth compared to 2014.

								<br><br>For passenger cars, the trends were more consistent, 
								with all countries starting at very low percentages in 2014 
								and showing astonishing growth by 2023. Northern countries, 
								including Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland, 
								consistently led the way, likely reflecting their early adoption of 
								policies supporting electric vehicles (EVs), such as tax incentives, 
								widespread charging infrastructure, and cultural acceptance of 
								sustainable technologies.

								<br><br>Lorries displayed a similar pattern to passenger cars, 
								but with a notable disparity: Denmark and the Netherlands had 
								significantly higher percentages than other countries. 
								This could stem from the prominence of logistics and freight industries 
								in these countries, incentivizing businesses to adopt more sustainable 
								fleets.

								<br><br>Road tractors experienced relatively modest growth overall, 
								with only minor increases in the last year. However, Sweden stood out 
								dramatically, achieving a percentage ten times greater than any other 
								country. This extraordinary difference may be attributed to Sweden's 
								focused initiatives on sustainable heavy vehicles and early 
								technological advancements in this area.

								<br><br>Goods road motor vehicles mirrored the trends of passenger cars, 
								with consistent growth across the board, reflecting a general alignment 
								with EU-wide goals for decarbonizing transport.

								<br><br>Overall, the European Union average increased across all vehicle 
								categories, with the steepest growth occurring in the most recent years. 
								The differing behaviors of countries can be partially explained by 
								variations in policy frameworks, economic conditions, 
								cultural attitudes toward sustainability, and the availability of 
								technology and infrastructure. Wealthier nations or those with robust 
								green initiatives tend to show earlier and more pronounced growth, 
								while others may experience slower progress due to economic or 
								logistical challenges.

								Fresh Nuclear Fuel Production in the EU - 2023
							</h3>
							<p>
								The histogram represents the production of fresh fuel elements, expressed in tonnes of Heavy Metal (tHM), across all the countries in the European Union that haven't banned yet nuclear energy.
								<br>The production of fresh fuel elements refers to the creation and fabrication of new fuel components (usually uranium or plutonium-based) that are used in nuclear reactors.
								<br>These fuel elements are essential for sustaining the nuclear fission process that generates energy within the reactor.
								<br><br><b>France</b> is the leading producer with 570 tHM, indicating a strong nuclear energy sector and possibly a significant number of reactors in operation.
								<br><b>Sweden</b>, with 360 tHM, also has a relatively large nuclear energy industry, reflecting its reliance on nuclear power for energy production.
								<br><b>Spain</b> and <b>Romania</b> follow with 280 tHM and 210 tHM, respectively, suggesting smaller but notable contributions to the production of fresh nuclear fuel.
								<br><b>Germany</b>, with 180 tHM, has the lowest production among these countries, which could be due to its ongoing transition away from nuclear energy in favor of renewable sources following the decision to phase out nuclear plants in the coming years.
