								Main plot
							</h3>
							<p>
								The plot displays two variables the heating degree days (HDD) index and the cooling degree days (CDD) index and are calculated on a daily basis with the following formulas HDD = max(18-T, 0) and CDD = max(T-21, 0) where T is the temperature of the day.<br>
								The plot shows the data with an annual granularity, and the value for a single year is calculated by summing all the values for that specific year.<br>
								The data depicted represent (in blue) European HDDs and (in red) European CDDs from 1979 to 2023, obviously being very different values there is a double vertical axis one for HDDs (left) and the other for CDDs (right), on the horizontal axis instead we find the years.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="plot1"></div>
						<div class="large-description">
							<p>
								As we can see from the plot, HDDs are steadily decreasing while CDDs are steadily increasing, which indicates to us how there are more and more warmer winters and summers in Europe over the years.<br>
								The trend is remarkably marked and this shows us how going forward over the years this situation will be more and more unbearable and will cause greater and greater damage, so something needs to be done to change the trend.<br>

								Ocean acidification
							</h3>
							<p>
								The heatmap shows the pH value of the ocean as the years change (starting from 1985).<br>
								On the horizontal axis we can find the years while on the vertical axis we have a single value, pH.<br>
								Shades of red indicate pH values lower than the optimal value 8.2 (in white), the more intense the red the further away we are from the optimal value.<br>
								As we can see going forward in years the sea is becoming more and more acidic and even in 1985 we were already far away from the optimal value that was present before the industrial revolution.<br>
								Ocean acidification can create conditions that eat away at the minerals used by oysters, clams, lobsters, shrimp, coral reefs, and other marine life to build their shells and skeletons.<br>
								In addition, too rapid a change in pH could lead to other life forms becoming extinct, unable to adapt so quickly to these changes.

								European economic losses
							</h3>
							<p>
								Many times when we talk about global warming someone intervenes by saying that climate change has always been there, thus somehow lifting the blame that human beings have in this change.<br>
								So it is also important to show the fact that we are the first to lose from this change, in fact the plot shows the rolling average of the last 30 years of european econimical losses due to climate change as the years change.<br>
								This measurement is perfect for showing the trend of a variable, which as in this case points out to us how economic losses are steadily and steeply increasing.<br>
								On the horizontal axis, in fact, we have the years, while on the vertical axis we have the economic losses in millions of euros, and we can see how only between 2011 and 2012 and between 2019 and 2020 this trend has dropped slightly while in all other years it is always increasing.
